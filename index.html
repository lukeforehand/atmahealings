                        I enjoy taking the Yogic practice a step deeper than what we usually have seen in the western culture. I feel fortunate to have learned Yoga in the place in which the roots run deep. Integrating yogic philosophy including the 8 limbs of Yoga, pranayama (breathwork), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), mantras, balance, and proper poses with the use of props. Using all these tools and really diving into each person's journey in understanding what Yoga is for them.
                    </p><br />
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        Some studios do not offer these kinds of teachings, they focus more on the physical aspect of yoga which are the Asanaâ€™s (postures). People seem to think that if you incorporate these other practices that some people would misinterpret those categories upon reading and assure that they are based into some sort of religious practice. Yoga is NOT a religion. It is a way of being. You can practice Yoga alongside any belief system that one may carry.
                    </p><br />
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        <b>The types of Yoga that are offered are Hatha Yoga and Vinyasa</b>. To really break things down and create a solid foundation in which to explore Yoga further, one must first attend a few of the workshops in either Hatha or Vinyasa to move forward to the classes. One may also demonstrate their knowledge before moving forward.
                    </p><br />
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                        <b>Hatha Work shops</b>: In a workshop environment there is a lot of instruction, really slowing down and truly understanding the mechanics of our own bodies focusing on one pose at a time, really diving deep into each one. There is lots of personal one on one attention to help explore your body as you move through the poses and what is right for you.

                        <b>Vinyasa Flow</b> stands in opposition to Hatha. Hatha classes tend to focus on one pose at a time with rest in between. In contrast, flow classes string poses together to make a sequence that is ever moving and flowing. Each movement is synchronized with the breath.

                        After being in the military for 11 years, finishing my bachelors degree in criminal justice, and getting certified in Law Enforcement & Corrections through the Wisconsin Police Academy, I was left with bodily injuries and spiritual drought.
                    <br /><br />
                        I traveled across multiple countries in search of the meaning and purpose I had been longing for. It had always been natural for me to hold a counsel space for others to release, share, vent. With this in mind, I pursued and completed a PhD program with an emphasis in Spiritual Counseling & Life Coaching. Still I was on my own spiritual journey and was amazed by my progress both physically and mentally in my Yoga practice. I noticed I felt more clear, my body was becoming limber, and I was managing the pain associated with my injuries for the first time in years . This ignited a fire to learn as much about Yoga as possible. I packed up my life, and went to India to pursue Yoga with no return date.
                    <br /><br />
                        I received a Yoga Teaching certification and continued to travel, practice counseling, and teaching yoga. I proceeded to expand my knowledge in different healing modalities including Reiki certification as well as other energy work practices, stone therapy, massage school & fire cupping, meditation, and traditional hand poke tattooing.
                    <br /><br />
                        I moved to the Ashland area in 2019 with my partner and our daughter. Ready to plant roots, live our dreams, speak our truth, and be a part of the community. From my own experience in healing, It has been meaningful to share this knowledge and wisdom with others, individually and communally. I bring these practices to the city of Ashland, not with the intention for a profitable business, but a platform in which all people regardless of their socio economic status, race, age, or gender can have a safe space to explore physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellness.
